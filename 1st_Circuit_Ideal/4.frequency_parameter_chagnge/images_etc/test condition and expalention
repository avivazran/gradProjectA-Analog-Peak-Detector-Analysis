the test check the frequency of input signal that the PD can follow.
the error that we allow for this test(for every configuration) is 10mV DELTA between the 
output to input in the time the imput arive to is peak, and for first period( after the first period the output charge and the delta is decrease.

detalis-input SINUS WAVEFORm WITH DC VOLTAGE OF 1.65V 
and small signal of 80mv
